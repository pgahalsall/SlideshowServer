I wake to find your hand in mine
We must have fell asleep last night, just right
The sunlights dancin' through the blinds
The day is waiting on the line, just outside, oo

Will you always be my love
Will you always be my love

Now cars are passing and birds are laughing as 
trees are holding up the sky in the window
do they feel it, have they seen it grow
have they been watching us, do they know?

Will you always be my love
Will you always be my love

Oo, oo, oo... 

Will you always be my love
Will you always be my love
